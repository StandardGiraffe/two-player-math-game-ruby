Two-Player Mental Math (Addition) Game
===

### Description:
A silly two-player adding game that runs in the commandline.  The purpose of this exercise was to implement newly-developed OOP archetypes in Ruby (this is day two of Ruby, after six weeks of JavaScript...).

Questions answered successfully become harder and harder, until one player is eliminated.

### How to use:
Clone the git and run
```bash
$ ruby main.rb
```

Have some tedious fun with a friend!
